Introduction
As organizations increasingly adopt Large Language Models (LLMs) for various applications, two primary approaches have emerged for customizing these models to specific use cases: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Fine-tuning. This blog post explores when to use each approach and how to implement them using Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Generative AI service.
Understanding RAG
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances LLM responses by providing relevant context from external documents or knowledge bases at inference time. Think of it as giving the model access to a customized reference library that it can consult while generating responses.
When to Use RAG
RAG is ideal when:

You need to work with frequently updated information
Your data contains specific facts, figures, or details that must be accurately referenced
You want to maintain clear provenance of information
You have limited computational resources or budget
You need to get started quickly with minimal training overhead
You want to maintain flexibility in switching between different base models

Advantages of RAG

No model training required
Easy to update knowledge base
Lower computational costs
Clear traceability of information sources
Maintains the base model's general capabilities

Limitations of RAG

May have higher latency due to retrieval step
Quality depends heavily on retrieval accuracy
Limited ability to learn new patterns or writing styles
Can struggle with complex reasoning that requires deep integration of knowledge

Understanding Fine-tuning
Fine-tuning involves further training an existing LLM on your specific dataset to adapt its behavior, knowledge, or capabilities to your particular use case.
When to Use Fine-tuning
Fine-tuning is preferred when:

You need the model to learn specific patterns or writing styles
You want consistent formatting or structured outputs
You need to optimize for lower latency
You have stable, well-defined requirements
You need the model to internalize complex domain-specific reasoning
You have high-quality training data available

Advantages of Fine-tuning

Better performance on specific tasks
Lower inference latency
More consistent output format
Can learn new patterns and behaviors
May require less prompt engineering

Limitations of Fine-tuning

Requires significant computational resources
Needs high-quality training data
More complex to update or maintain
Risk of catastrophic forgetting
Higher cost and technical expertise required
